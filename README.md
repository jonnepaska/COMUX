# COMUX

COMUX is an Arch-based Linux distribution aimed at making it easier for new users to get started with Linux. It is designed to provide a simple and lightweight environment, especially for those coming from Windows.

## About

- **Arch-based:** COMUX uses Arch Linux as its foundation, giving users access to the Arch ecosystem and rolling updates.
- **For new users:** The distro comes with sensible defaults and pre-configured tools to help users get started without complicated setup.
- **Hobby project:** COMUX is primarily a school project, and the development team is usually only 1–3 active members. Updates can be irregular.
- **Early stage:** Don’t expect a fully polished experience yet; the project is evolving step by step.

## Features

- Lightweight and fast
- Gaming-friendly (Steam, Proton, and GPU drivers ready)
- Simple boot menu and installer

## Installation

Instructions for creating a bootable USB or testing in a virtual machine will be provided soon. This is an ongoing project, so check back for updates.

## Contributing

COMUX is currently developed by a small team. If you want to contribute, feel free to open issues or pull requests, but keep in mind this is a hobby project and contributions may take time to review.

## Disclaimer

COMUX is a school project and still under development. Do not expect enterprise-level stability or full feature support.
